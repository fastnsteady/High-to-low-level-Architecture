# High-to-low-level-Architecture
1. Analyzed High-Level Business Requirement
• Received the high-level business requirement from the user or project
documentation.
• Carefully reviewed the objective and pipeline details to understand the scope
and expected outcomes.
2. Broke Down the Requirement into Modules, Schemas, and Pseudocode
• Identified the main functional modules needed to fulfill the business
requirement.
• Defined the core entities and designed the database schema, specifying tables
and key fields.
• Outlined the APIs required for data sourcing and integration.
• Drafted concise pseudocode to illustrate the essential classes and methods
involved in the solution.
3. Designed and Implemented an Automation Tool
• Developed a Python script that automated the conversion of high-level
requirements into low-level technical specifications.
• Implemented a prompt generation function to structure the requirement for an
AI model.
• Integrated with an LLM (e.g., Llama 3) to process the prompt and return a
structured, detailed technical breakdown.
• Parsed and displayed the output in a clear format, including tech stack, APIs,
modules, database schema, and pseudocode.
4. Tested the Tool with Sample Requirements
• Entered various high-level requirements into the tool to verify that it generated
accurate and comprehensive low-level technical details.
• Reviewed the outputs to ensure all necessary technical aspects were covered
and formatted as specified.
5. Documented the Pipeline and Output Example
• Recorded the pipeline steps, tool structure, and a full example conversion from
high-level to low-level architecture.
• Included an example output with sections for Tech Stack, APIs, Modules,
Database Schema, and Pseudocode.
